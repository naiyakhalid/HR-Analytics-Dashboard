# Project Insights
- Salary Concentration: Most employees earn between $40,000 and $100,000, as shown by the salary distribution histogram.
- Gender Composition: The workforce consists of 55% Male and 45% Female, indicating near balance but worth monitoring for equity at senior levels.
- Department Headcount: The Sales department is the largest, with 224 employees, highlighting where HR policies may have the greatest impact.
- Performance & Pay: Average FTE salary consistently rises with higher salary bands and performance levels, showing alignment between compensation and performance.
- Tenure vs Salary: The scatter plot shows no strong correlation between salary and tenure, suggesting salary growth is not purely tenure-based and may depend more on role, performance, or market factors.
- Age Distribution: Majority of employees fall in the 30-39 and 40-44 age groups, pointing to a mid-career heavy workforce.


## Conclusion
The HR Interactive Dashboard successfully presents a high-level and detailed view of workforce demographics and compensation patterns. It equips HR leaders with the insights needed to:
- Monitor and promote pay equity
- Identify areas for diversity and inclusion initiatives
- Evaluate salary structures in relation to tenure and performance
