• Salary Concentration: Most employees earn between $40,000 and $100,000, as shown by the salary distribution histogram.
• Gender Composition: The workforce consists of 55% Male and 45% Female, indicating near balance but worth monitoring for equity at senior levels.

• Performance & Pay: Average FTE salary consistently rises with higher salary bands and performance levels, showing alignment between compensation and performance.
• Tenure vs Salary: The scatter plot shows no strong correlation between salary and tenure, suggesting salary growth is not purely tenure-based and may depend more on role, performance, or market factors.
• Age Distribution: Majority of employees fall in the 30-39 and 40-44 age groups, pointing to a mid-career heavy workforce.
